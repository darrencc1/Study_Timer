io: used for input/output for user commands and printing to consoe.

This allows synchronization for SAFELY sharing data between threads
Arc: (Atomic Reference Count) allows multiple threads to SHARE ownership of a value. Ensures memory safety when accessing shared resources across threads
Mutex:(Mutual Exclusion) only **1** thread can access the value it protects at a time, prevents race conditions
ex. pause_flag

Provides atomic types and operations for low level SYNCRONIZATION without locking
AtomicBool: Thread safe bool type supporting atomic operations

ex. Ordering::SeqCst: Sequential consistency, esuring all threads see changes in SAME order.
