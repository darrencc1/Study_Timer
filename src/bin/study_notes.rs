/*
This is a standalone program, which is why I am using another binary, this is simply notes and practice for the actual project and learning rust. 

cargo run
mkdir src/bin ... multiple binaries are allowed, this creates a new binary in the src folder
mv src/study_notes.rs src/bin/study_notes.rs ... This moves the file to where you want by the command prompt, you can manually move it as well.
cargo run --bin study_notes ... this runs the specific binary folder study_notes 
 
 ***NOTE*** you can directly run a file without making another binary:
 rustc src/study_notes.rs (File is not in bin for this), This compiles the file directly.
 then: ./study_notes to run the compiled binary. This does NOT use Cargos features like dependency management.
