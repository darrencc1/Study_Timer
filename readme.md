## Overview

**Rust Study Management**:

**Project Description**:
Create something that the user can use to create different timers, or sets of timers, so that they can manage their study time vs break time without having to directly interact with the program at every alarm. Example is 20 minutes of study with 5 min breaks inbetween, with every 3rd 20min study session having a 15 min break  

**Project Goals**:
Learn Rust in a  way that is not just its syntax but on the deeper level of how it is managing space, how and why is it more secure, and how to leverage this capability.
