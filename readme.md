## Overview

**Rust Study Management**:

**Project Description**:
This is a study timer designed to help people to study for some time, take a short break and study or do work again. After a chosen number of sessions the user can take a long break. This will alert the user that the break or study time is over. 

**Project Goals**:
Learn Rust syntax and how it interacts with memory. Create something that I will personally use to improve study habits and quality of time spent.
## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Ensure rust is downloaded
2. Have visual studio code and get the rust-analyzer extension
3. in the console: cargo run --bin Study_Timer
this will run the program.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the program in the command prompt
2. Respond to questions for study time and breaks.
3.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* make sure cargo.toml has rodio = ".17" to ensure it plays mp3 file correctly.
* make sure cargo is updated and current. run... cargo update ...in command prompt
*

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software and learning new things for rust:

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [Data collection for users to see what is optimal for study time vs break time for individual users and potentially all users in future] 
* [Using Threads to allow users to pause, play and stop timer.]
* [Have a better visual for the timer outside of the command prompt so this can be used more as a desktop app than just command prompt usage.]
